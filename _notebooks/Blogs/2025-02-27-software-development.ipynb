    "The Software Development Lifecycle is the process used by software developers to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. It defines a series of steps or stages that guide the creation of software, from initial planning to the final product release. The Software Development Lifecycle ensures that software is developed systematically, efficiently, and meets quality standards."

    "Source control (or version control) is the practice of managing and tracking changes to the codebase over time. Git is one of the most popular tools used for source control. It allows developers to keep track of every modification made to the project, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.\n",

    "Forking is the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's project. This allows developers to make changes and experiment without affecting the original project. Forking is common when contributing to open-source projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it’s important: Forking allows independent work on a copy of the project, providing freedom to experiment while keeping the original project safe. Once changes are ready, developers can propose them back to the original project."

    "Branching is the creation of a new line of development in the codebase. Developers use branches to work on different features or bug fixes without interfering with the main code (often called main or master).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it’s important: It enables multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. It also allows for a clean, isolated workspace to develop new features or fix bugs."

    "Building refers to the process of converting source code into an executable form. This could involve compiling code, linking libraries, and preparing the project for testing or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why it’s important: Building is essential because it verifies that the code is syntactically and logically correct. It ensures that the codebase is ready for further testing, integration, or production use."

    "A pull request is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. When a developer finishes working on a feature or bug fix in their branch, they create a pull request to request that their changes be reviewed and merged into the main codebase.\n",
    "\n",
