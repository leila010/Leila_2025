    "This refers to repeating a set of instructions multiple times. It allows you to perform an action repeatedly, such as going through items in a list, or performing a task until a certain condition is met. It helps automate repetitive tasks and makes code more efficient."

    "Conditions allow you to make decisions in your program. They evaluate whether something is true or false and execute different code based on the result. If a condition is true, one block of code runs; if it's false, another block of code may run. It enables the program to react to different situations."

    "Nested conditions occur when one condition is placed inside another. This allows for more specific decision-making. If a condition within a condition is true, it will trigger further checks or actions, helping to handle more complex scenarios where multiple factors need to be evaluated."
