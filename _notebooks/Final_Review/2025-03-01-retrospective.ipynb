    "### **6 Things I've Learned Over 24 Weeks:**\n",
    "/ᐠ˵- ᴗ -˵マ ᶻ 𝗓 𐰁\n",
    "#### - **Skills Learned:**\n",
    "During the 24 weeks, I have learned multiple, if not possibly 20+ skills in taking this class. I have learned how to look at code, understand code, use GitHub, make issues, issue burndowns, live reviews, do presentations, understand how commits work and branches, pull requests, and so much more I can continue to list on. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - **Burn Down:**\n",
    "Burn downs are where you can make an issue, or just a blank template where you input all your ideas, and a checklist step by step on how you plan to complete it. You can make time predictions to stay on track and have continued progression throughout your project. I have learned how to do Burn Down, which is **_extremely_** helpful and a very productive tactic to use when wanting to plan out how to complete certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - **Lesson(s) Taught:**\n",
    "Creating and learning lessons was a fun and new challenge I experienced in my 24 weeks of this class. It was new and fun to be able to teach your class a subject.  I found it very useful and helpful when researching with my group on a subject and teaching it. It helped me understand the concepts more and was helpful for my education progression in coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - **Live Reviews:**\n",
    "Live reviews being another new thing I experienced was fun and interesting, being able to work with your team online, while seeing each other work at the same time, was very useful and made us as a whole more productive. I extremely like the idea of live reviews, it's very convenient and easy to set up and accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - **Presentation(s) Given:**\n",
    "The idea of giving a presentation in front of your class is 100% not the first great thing that I would want to do that would come to mind. But rest assured I had to give quite a few in this class, and I believe that it helped me improve giving out presentations more. Speaking about your game, or a lesson in front of your class gives you experience that you would never have thought you could get. It helped me personally with giving out better and more scripted presentations and making sure that I had accurate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - **GitHub Analytics:**\n",
    "GitHub Analytics are very helpful in showing me my progress of commits and contributions throughout the months. I have learned how to see and understand commits, I have learned how to go through my commits, search through them, make them, and _multiple_ other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - **Summary:**\n",
    "When creating my CRF for 9th grade, CSSE was not my first option, it was my second. Truthfully, I only put it there just in case if I did not get into my first choice and I \"jokingly\" signed up for it as my 2nd choice as a slight joke to my father. Little did I know I ended up here in CSSE anyways. I never liked coding too much and thought it wasn't something I enjoyed. But little did I know _once again_ that coding wasn't bad...at all. I have learned so many new things I never knew about, and have seen and experienced things I never thought I would get to know. Due to this class I have gained a **_much_** better liking towards coding. Because of this class and its very fun curriculum, I now do extremely enjoy coding, I do find joy now in looking through code (if it's not for bugs) and seeing things work and come together. I am quite grateful for getting into this class! ദ്ദി/ᐠ｡‸｡ᐟ\\\n",

    "- Majority of the feedback I got was from random people (not sure if in comp class) around and curious, I got some people from one of the AP classes, some from parents, and some from CSSE. \n",

    "#### **Discord Basment:** \n",
    "Super cool game, I extremely liked the custom NPC (I think) and how it has an array of multiple conversations you can have with it. I also like the background and the graphics of the game, the computers having animations, including the NPC, was extremely cool and gave me some inspiration. I also enjoyed how you could interact with items around the room and with the computer. The perception of traveling through a phone (I believe) into this basement with the way to escape is to get enough money to please the NPC is a very fun and creative idea that I extremely enjoyed.\n",

    "#### Jungle Game\n",
    "Wasn't able to learn too much about it sadly, but it caught my eye when I got to view the screen. The background and NPCs were extremely cool and the concept seemed great. Also, I enjoyed how they designed the graphics of the game and made the theme fit well together.\n",
    "\n",
    "NO IMAGE SADLY\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Desert Game!!\n",
    "I **_EXTREMELY_** liked the concept of this game, it's a game where your a time traveler and you got teleported to a desert. There are CUSTOM NPC designs which are extremely cool, and the goal of the game is to go to the pyramid and get chased by a cat to a time traveler machine back to where you came from. Honestly, the concept is extremely cool, and it seemed like they were extremely passionate about their game and the origins. Great game overall!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Future for CompSci:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interests:**\n",
    "I am extremely interested in building and coding game(s). I do hope one day to create my own RPG game, and with the skills I've learned from this class, it could help me start on a possible game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classes:**\n",
    "It is a very big stretch, but maybe in the near future I could consider joining the AP computer science classes. But if I were to even consider the opportunity of joining more advanced classes, I would hope to learn and join computer programs to help gather more experience for a better learning opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **College:**\n",
    "Entering college for computer science...is not impossible. I am currently still undecided what I will major in the future, but I am considering options and things I have an interest in. Computer science being one of them for sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Internships:**\n",
    "It would be a blessing to be able to get an internship at a workspace where I can experience hands-on coding from professionals. Get to see how they work together, and see what everyone works on, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Career:**\n",
    "Doing computer science as a career would be something else, if I were to do that, I would most likely lean towards creating games /  doing game development.\n",

    "| Behavior       | [Y]            | 4          | 0.9   | I hope to say I have good behavior, I try my best to be as respectful as possible and to stay on task and not goof around. |\n",
    "| Timeliness     | [N]            | 3          | 0.75  | This category can improve majorly, I can improve in this. For example, instead of going bitter last in reviews, I should try my best to go sooner, more on time, etc. This also includes being done with my work (coding changes) on a more timely manner. |\n",
    "| Tech Sense     | [N]            | 3          | 0.75  | In 24 weeks I feel like I should know more than I do, but still I know some sense. But also, I can always learn more in a technical sense, and understanding code more. |\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Next Steps:**\n",
    "My game at the moment is quite boring, there is just an epic start page and some other things, but nothing too exciting. If I were to continue building on my game, I would want to add more game features, and continue on my ideas about interacting with NPCs and being able to chat with them, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Strengths:**\n",
    "There is a very **_EPIC_** start page and ending credits page! Also, there is a button that takes you to a place about NPCs! So exciting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:**\n",
    "The game in general is very boring, if I were to play this game, I would enjoy the beginning and ending with no enjoyment in between. Also, the Players \"walking\" speeds are weird and makes the game not as great to play. To include, I feel like I could add more levels and more excitement into the game. Like an epic bossfight or a mission to complete.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Summary Self Grade Assessment w/ Reasoning:**\n",
    "Overall, my work in the 24 weeks I was given is....not great. I focused much more on thinking and creating plans for the games rather than actual coding...well until the end. I believe I was more focused on the not-so-important things rather than the things that needed work on. But either way, I have learned through my past mistakes and have enjoyed this class even with some of the hardships we all faced.  \n",
