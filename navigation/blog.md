### Final Review (progress,etc)
_**Process of Planning:**_
-We created an issue to plan/brainstorm our ideas for the game.
-I and the rest of my team planned by making a issue filled with ideas and images of possible changes and possibilites to add to our game.

**Coding:**
-While working on this game I have learned lots of coding on the way; I learned how to replace images and remove backgrounds to input into the game. I learned on how to changed the position of items in the game by changing the coordinates. I also have experimeneted with other ideas, such as on how to end the game by collecting all coins.

**Studied:**
-I have had to study on how to do multiple things in the game. For example, I had to learn on how to create my own branch from a repository and clone it. I also had to study on how to replace images, and I have used multiple resources on how to (try) to change the ending.

**Changes:**
-Me and my time have changed lots of things together and collaberated on multiple resources, such as slack, liveshare, etc. Some changes I have personally made is the parallax background, platforms, position of coins, etc. But all together we have changed much more than that including the tokens, sprints, etc.

**Mistakes:**
-I have made lots of mistakes and attempts to try and change the code for the best. Some of the multiple mistakes I have made is changing the ending to the game, I have tried to change the code, and input the given information into the code and with the help of AI and team memmbers I still haven't figured it out. At the momment we all are trying our best to crack the code. 

**Highlights:**
-Being able to have implemented changes into the game
-Tried my best to change the code into a deeper level
-Collaberated to the best of my abilites with my teammates
-Learned and had lots of mistakes along the way which helped me get a better understanding of coding, etc

**Summary:**
-Overall I have learned and got a better understanding of lots of elements in the game and process of it all. Now for Sprint 5 it is I and my team memmbers goal to figure out and study on how to change the ending properly.
