### Final Review (progress, etc)
_**Process of Planning:**_
-We created an issue to plan/brainstorm our ideas for the game.
-I and the rest of my team planned by making an issue filled with ideas and images of possible changes and possibilities to add to our game.

**Coding:**
-While working on this game I learned lots of coding on the way; I learned how to replace images and remove backgrounds to input into the game. I learned how to change the position of items in the game by changing the coordinates. I also have experimented with other ideas, such as how to end the game by collecting all coins.

**Studied:**
-I have had to study how to do multiple things in the game. For example, I had to learn how to create my branch from a repository and clone it. I also had to study how to replace images, and I have used multiple resources on how to (try) to change the ending.

**Changes:**
-My team and I have changed many things together and collaborated on multiple resources, such as Slack, liveshare, etc. Some changes I have personally made are the parallax background, platforms, position of coins, etc. But all together we have changed much more than that including the tokens, sprints, etc.

**Mistakes:**
-I have made lots of mistakes and attempts to try and change the code for the best. One of the multiple mistakes I have made is changing the ending to the game, I have tried to change the code and input the given information into the code, and with the help of AI and team members, I still haven't figured it out. At the moment we all are trying our best to crack the code. 

**Highlights:**
-Being able to implement changes into the game
-Tried my best to change the code to a deeper level
-Collaborated to the best of my abilities with my teammates
-Learned and had lots of mistakes along the way which helped me get a better understanding of coding, etc

**Summary:**
-Overall I have learned and got a better understanding of lots of elements in the game and the process of it all. Now for Sprint 5, it's our goal to figure out and study how to change the ending properly.
